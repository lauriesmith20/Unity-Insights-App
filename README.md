# Unity-Insights-App

**_A PyQt5 app designed to produce an Excel export of data selected from the Quality & Outcome Framework (QOF) data set, based on criteria selected in-app._**

This app was conceptualised and designed to improve ease of access to the QOF data set when accessing data for specific GP Practices or regions, and across multiple years. Rather than downloading many different .csv or Excel workbooks, the app enables users to access the data in one place, and in a single neat and readable Excel export.

This was originally designed to be used solely on Microsoft machines, but is in the process of being redesigned to work more smoothly across different platforms. 

The .csv files are collated and re-arranged from the data set published annually by NHS Digital. The publications dating back to 2016-17 have been used, although there are publications dating back further available.
