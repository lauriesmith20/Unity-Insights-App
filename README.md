# Unity-Insights-App

**_A PyQt5 app designed to produce an Excel export of data selected from the Quality & Outcome Framework (QOF) data set, based on criteria selected in-app._**

This was originally designed to be used solely on Microsoft machines, but is in the process of being redesigned to work more smoothly across different platforms. 

The .csv files are collated and re-arranged from the data set published annually by NHS Digital. The publications back to 2016-17 have been used, although there are publications dating back further.
